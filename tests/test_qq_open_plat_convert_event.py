"""Group-id key fallback in the QQ Open Platform event converter.

``_convert_event`` used to read only ``group_id``. The channel's group
identifier is in fact an openid, and the v2 payload may carry it under
``group_openid`` instead; when that happens ``group_id`` is the empty
string, the backlog writer drops the message outright, and the group
subject degrades to ``qq::`` which the scope validator rejects.

The fallback order is the load-bearing part: ``group_id`` must keep
winning when present. Flipping it would re-key every group subject_id,
and scope matching is byte equality with no aliasing, so all existing
scoped group memories would be orphaned in one shot.

The ``author`` blocks below carry the real protocol keys. They used to say
``{"id": ...}``, which is the very assumption that turned out to be wrong --
see ``test_qq_open_platform_actor_identity.py`` for where the speaker id
actually comes from.
