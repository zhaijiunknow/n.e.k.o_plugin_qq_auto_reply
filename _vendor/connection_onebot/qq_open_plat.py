# ==========================================
# R11 identity scope: resolved
# (docs/design/speaker-trust-entity-semantics.md §2.15.4)
# ==========================================
#
# Conclusion: in Open Platform group/private events there is **no ``id`` key under
# ``author``**. This rests on two official first-party Tencent sources that
# corroborate each other:
#
# - The official docs bot-docs `server-inter/message/send-receive/event.md` field
#   table and example JSON: `C2C_MESSAGE_CREATE`'s author has only `user_openid`;
#   `GROUP_AT_MESSAGE_CREATE`'s author has only `member_openid`, and the group
#   identifier is `group_openid`;
# - The official SDK botpy `message.py`: `C2CMessage._User` reads only
#   `user_openid`, `GroupMessage._User` reads only `member_openid`; only the
#   **channel**-system `Message._User` has `id` -- and this connector does not
#   handle channel message events.
#
# Yet `author.get("id")` was what this file used to read (copied from
# napcat/OneBot's `sender.user_id`; even the `<@!(\d+)>` pure-digit regex was a
# product of the same copy). As a result both paths' user_id was **always empty**:
# every speaker collapsed into one empty identity, `_maybe_reserve_open_platform_admin`
# never fired (because `not sender_id`), and private replies POSTed to
# `/v2/users//messages`.
#
# The official "unique identity mechanism" also answers the scope question: *the
# same bot sees a different per-group unique id (member_openid) for the same user*.
# So R11 is confirmed and `actor_scope = per_conversation`, taking the degraded
# path per §2.15.4.3 (registration in `settings_service.declare_identity_scope`;
# the manual-assertion UI is on the trusted-user page).
#
# The forensics constants / functions below are **kept**: the official doc field
# table does not guarantee an exhaustive enumeration of the real payload (e.g. an
# undocumented union_openid sibling key), so keeping them lets us confirm on a live
# bot. Default off; never participates in any decision.
