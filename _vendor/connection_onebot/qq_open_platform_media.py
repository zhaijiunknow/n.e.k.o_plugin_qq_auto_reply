"""QQ Open Platform rich media: image upload and image sending.

Image sending on the Open Platform is not one request but two: upload the bytes to
get a ``file_info``, then send a ``msg_type=7`` message carrying it. Both halves are
QQ-platform-specific, so they live here rather than in the platform-neutral
``base`` layer.

Two upload protocols coexist on this platform:

1. **Legacy direct upload** — ``POST /v2/{scope}/{id}/files`` with
   ``file_type``/``file_name``/``file_size``/``mime_type``, which answers with an
   ``upload_url`` to ``PUT`` the bytes to. This is what the transport class used
   before; the current platform docs no longer list those request fields, and a live
   run on 2026-09-26 showed the group flow failing on it.
2. **Documented upload** — either a **URL upload** (hand the platform an http(s)
   address and let it fetch), or a **chunked upload**
   (``upload_prepare`` → per-part ``PUT`` + ``upload_part_finish`` → merge).
   A local file cannot use the URL flow.

So for local files both are attempted, legacy first: that keeps the previously
working deployment working, and whichever succeeds is named in the log, which is how
"which protocol is still alive" gets answered without guessing.

Shape
-----

The actions sit on :class:`QQOpenPlatformMediaMixin`, the same way NapCat /
go-cqhttp extensions sit on ``NapCatActionsMixin``: the transport class stays about
the protocol, and a platform's extras stay in one place next to it. Mixing it into
``QQOpenPlatformConnection`` overrides ``send_group_image`` (same name, and the
transport's own implementation is the stale legacy path described above) and adds
``upload_image`` and ``send_private_image``.

The consuming plugin cannot add bases to the host's class, and it resolves whichever
connector the host provides -- the host's, or its own vendored copy. The three
operations therefore also exist as module-level wrappers taking any connection
object. Each wrapper binds the mixin over that object (:class:`_MediaAdapter`: mixin
methods win, everything else comes from the connection) and calls one mixin method,
so the flow lives in exactly one place and there is no second implementation to
drift. On the day the host class composes the mixin, the adapter steps aside.

Dependencies
------------

Only these members of the connection object, all present on the resolved connector
(``tests/test_qq_open_platform_media.py`` guards them): ``_http``, ``_API_BASE``,
``_ensure_token()``, ``_auth_headers()``, ``logger``, and ``record_sent_message_id()``
for the send half.
